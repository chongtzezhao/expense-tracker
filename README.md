# expense-tracker

Ever felt that having a separate app to track your expenses is too much of a hassle?
Are you tired of backing up your expense tracking app every week or so? 
With the expense-tracker, you will no longer have to worry about tracking your expenses, all without cluttering your phone!

This script allows you to track your expenses in a google sheet, and allows the telegram bot to communicate with it. 
All you have to do is send a message to the telegram bot containing 
1) how much you've spent
2) what you've spent it on
3) how you paid for it.
The google sheet will then be able to show how much you have spent over the course of the year.
